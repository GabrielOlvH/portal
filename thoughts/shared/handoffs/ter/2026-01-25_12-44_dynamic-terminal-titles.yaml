goal: Plan dynamic terminal names showing title bar content from processes
now: Implement the plan at thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-dynamic-terminal-names.md

test: pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint

done_this_session:
  - task: Researched terminal session naming architecture
    files: [agent/src/agents.ts, agent/src/sessions.ts, components/SessionCard.tsx]
  - task: Created implementation plan for dynamic terminal titles
    files: [thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-dynamic-terminal-names.md]
  - task: Created handoff documentation
    files: [thoughts/handoffs/dynamic-terminal-names/plan-dynamic-terminal-names.md]

blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - use_pane_title: User clarified they want terminal title bar (#{pane_title}) not command name (#{pane_current_command})
  - display_strategy: Show title when set, fall back to session name
  - filter_defaults: Filter out hostname/shell defaults to avoid showing useless info

findings:
  - tmux_pane_title: "#{pane_title} captures what processes set via escape sequences like \\e]0;title\\a"
  - cli_title_support: Many CLIs set titles - vim (vim - filename), htop, npm, Claude Code
  - existing_queries: Current session listing only queries session metadata, not pane info

worked:
  - scout agent for initial codebase exploration
  - tldr search for finding specific patterns

failed: []

next:
  - Add title field to Session type in lib/types.ts
  - Query pane_title from tmux in agent/src/sessions.ts
  - Include title in session API response
  - Update SessionCard, home screen, terminal labels to show title
