goal: Plan AI Sessions integration with Projects feature
now: Implement Task 1 - Add AI Sessions to LaunchSheet CommandStep

test: pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint

done_this_session:
  - task: Explored Projects feature architecture
    files: [lib/projects-store.tsx, app/projects/new.tsx, lib/types.ts]
  - task: Explored AI Sessions feature implementation
    files: [app/ai-sessions/index.tsx, agent/src/http/routes/ai-sessions.ts, lib/api.ts]
  - task: Analyzed LaunchSheet component for integration points
    files: [components/LaunchSheet.tsx]
  - task: Created integration plan (LaunchSheet approach instead of new tab)
    files: [thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-ai-sessions-integration.md]

blockers: []

questions:
  - Should AI sessions appear above or below npm scripts in CommandStep?

decisions:
  - launchsheet_integration: User preferred integrating via LaunchSheet/Projects rather than adding a new tab
  - path_matching: Use session.directory.startsWith(project.path) for matching
  - no_new_tabs: Keep existing tab structure, use LaunchSheet for prominence

findings:
  - launchsheet_flow: Host → Project → Command (3 steps with animated pager)
  - ai_session_directory: AiSession.directory maps to Project.path for matching
  - resume_api_exists: resumeAiSession(host, provider, id) creates tmux session

worked:
  - Using scout agents for parallel codebase exploration
  - LaunchSheet pattern is extensible for AI sessions

failed: []

next:
  - Implement Task 1: Add AI Sessions section to LaunchSheet CommandStep
  - Fetch AI sessions filtered by project directory
  - Show resume button with provider icon
  - Implement Task 2: Add session count badge to project cards
