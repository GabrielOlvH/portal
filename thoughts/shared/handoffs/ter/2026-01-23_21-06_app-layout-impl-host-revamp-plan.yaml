goal: App layout revamp - Projects tab implemented, host page revamp in planning
now: Complete host detail page revamp using findings in ~/.claude/plans/ agents' exploration
test: pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint

done_this_session:
  - task: Implemented Projects tab replacing Docker tab
    files: [app/(tabs)/projects.tsx, app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx]
  - task: Added Docker section to host detail page
    files: [app/hosts/[id]/index.tsx]
  - task: Removed Projects from More tab
    files: [app/(tabs)/more.tsx]
  - task: Updated navigation references
    files: [app/(tabs)/hosts.tsx]
  - task: Deleted old Docker tab file
    files: [app/(tabs)/docker.tsx]
  - task: Removed Open Sessions from Projects tab
    files: [app/(tabs)/projects.tsx]
  - task: Explored host detail page structure for revamp
    files: []

blockers: []

questions:
  - Disk usage data not available from API - user wanted it but HostInfo lacks disk metrics
  - Should Create Session section also be removed from host detail page?

decisions:
  - projects_tab_sections: Recent Launches + Projects List (removed Open Sessions per user request)
  - docker_inline: Docker containers now inline on host detail pages, not a separate tab
  - host_card_resources: User wants CPU/Memory%, Uptime/Load, and Disk (disk not available in API)

findings:
  - host_info_data: HostInfo has cpu.usage, memory.usedPercent, uptime, load[] - no disk data
  - session_section_location: Sessions section at lines 495-506 in host detail, sessionCards useMemo at 243-291
  - host_card_current: Shows sessionCount, containerCount, cpu%, ram% in stats row
  - hooks_available: useHostLive returns sessions, hostInfo, docker in state object

worked:
  - Parallel agent orchestration for tab system changes
  - Scout agents for codebase exploration
  - User confirmation before file deletion

failed: []

next:
  - Remove Sessions section from host detail page
  - Remove Create Session section from host detail page
  - Update HostCard to show CPU/Memory/Uptime/Load instead of session/container counts
  - Remove Docker button from HostCard (Docker now on host detail page)
  - Exit plan mode and implement host revamp
