blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - portal_name: User chose "Portal" - works in English and Portuguese, matches logo concept
  - system_fonts: Reverted to system fonts (SF Pro/Roboto) after custom fonts didn't apply consistently
  - jetbrains_mono: Keep for monospace/terminal only, loaded via Google Fonts in WebView

findings:
  - expo_fonts_webview: Fonts loaded via expo-google-fonts don't apply to WebView - need Google Fonts CSS
  - hardcoded_fonts: Several files had hardcoded fontFamily that bypassed AppText

worked:
  - Loading fonts from Google Fonts CDN for terminal WebView
  - Portal blue color scale (slate-900 for dark mode bg)
  - Removing unused font packages to reduce bundle

failed:
  - Plus Jakarta Sans and Inter didn't consistently apply across all components on iOS

next:
  - Implement terminal font settings per PLAN-terminal-font-settings.md
  - Phase 1: Add types and store for terminal settings
  - Phase 2: Update terminal-html.ts to accept font config
  - Phase 3: Wire up terminal screens to pass font settings
  - Phase 4: Add settings UI in more.tsx
