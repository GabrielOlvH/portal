goal: Plan app layout revamp - replace Docker tab with Projects, move Docker to host pages
now: Review plan at thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-app-layout-revamp.md and run /implement_plan
test: pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint

done_this_session:
  - task: Researched current tab structure and navigation
    files: [app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx, app/(tabs)/docker.tsx, app/(tabs)/more.tsx]
  - task: Analyzed Docker functionality and integration points
    files: [app/(tabs)/docker.tsx, app/hosts/[id]/index.tsx, lib/docker-hooks.ts]
  - task: Reviewed Projects and AI Sessions architecture
    files: [app/projects/index.tsx, app/ai-sessions/index.tsx, lib/projects-store.tsx]
  - task: Created comprehensive implementation plan with 7 tasks
    files: [thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-app-layout-revamp.md]

blockers: []

questions:
  - Verify useDocker(host) hook exists for single-host Docker queries
  - Confirm users don't heavily rely on cross-host Docker aggregation view

decisions:
  - tab_replacement: Replace Docker tab with Projects (keep 4 tabs) rather than adding 5th
  - inline_docker: Show Docker containers directly on host detail pages
  - three_section_layout: Recent Launches + Open Sessions + Projects List for comprehensive UX

findings:
  - docker_tab_cross_host: Current Docker tab aggregates ALL containers across ALL hosts - this view will be lost
  - container_routes_safe: Container detail routes at app/hosts/[id]/docker/[containerId]/ remain unchanged
  - recent_launches_exists: RecentLaunch state and addRecentLaunch() already in projects-store
  - host_docker_link: Host detail page already has Docker link at line 263

worked:
  - Using scout agents for parallel codebase exploration
  - TLDR structure commands for understanding file organization

failed: []

next:
  - Review plan at thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-app-layout-revamp.md
  - Run /implement_plan thoughts/shared/plans/PLAN-app-layout-revamp.md
  - Task 1: Update tab configuration (_layout.tsx)
  - Task 2: Create new projects tab file
  - Task 3: Add Docker section to host detail page
  - Task 4: Build three-section Projects tab UI
