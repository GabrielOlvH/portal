blockers: []

questions: []

decisions:
  - native-alert-prompt: Used Alert.prompt for rename instead of custom modal for native iOS feel
  - swipe-convention: Kill on right (swipe left) matches iOS destructive action convention

findings:
  - systemColors-opaquevalue: iOS systemColors return OpaqueColorValue, need ColorValue type for compatibility

worked:
  - Card-based sections with dividers for forms
  - List layout simpler than cards for file browser
  - Alert.prompt cleaner than custom modal

failed: []

next:
  - Test UI changes on physical device
  - Verify Alert.prompt works correctly on both iOS and Android
  - Check dark mode appearance of new designs
